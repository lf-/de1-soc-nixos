Subject: [PATCH 1/2] socfpga: fix the serial console on DE1-SoC

Previously, the TX LED would flash but nothing would appear on the
serial port, and the board would appear dead with a build of the
socfpga_cyclone5_defconfig. I have verified that adding the frequency to
the uart will fix the serial console on my board.

Thanks to @ehoffman on the Rocketboards forum:
